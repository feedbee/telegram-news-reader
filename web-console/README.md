# Web Console

The **Web Console** is a standalone, pull-based user interface for reading Telegram channel summaries generated by the Transform component.

## Architecture

The component consists of two layers:
1. **Frontend**: A React-based Single Page Application (SPA).
2. **Backend**: A FastAPI-based proxy that handles API requests and serves static frontend assets. It includes a **60-second timeout** for proxying to allow the AI summarization to complete.

## Running with Docker (Recommended)

The easiest way to run the Web Console along with the rest of the platform is using Docker Compose from the project root:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

The console will be available at **http://localhost**.

To build and run only the Web Console container:

```bash
docker build -t web-console -f web-console/Dockerfile .
docker run -p 8001:8001 --env TRANSFORM_URL=http://your-transform-host:8000 web-console
```

## Running Manually (Development)

For local development, you should run the backend and frontend separately.

### 1. Prerequisites
- Python 3.12+
- Node.js 20+

### 2. Backend Setup
The backend proxies requests to the Transform service and serves the frontend.

```bash
cd web-console/backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Set the transform URL if it's not running on localhost:8000
export TRANSFORM_URL=http://localhost:8000
python main.py
```
The backend API will be available at `http://localhost:8001`.

### 3. Frontend Setup
The frontend uses Vite for development.

```bash
cd web-console/frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
The frontend development server will be available at `http://localhost:5173`. It is configured to proxy `/api` requests to the backend running on `http://localhost:8001`.

## Features
- **Channel Selection**: Choose from active channels defined in `config.json`.
- **Summary Pulling**: Request summaries starting from a specific `last_message_id`.
- **Local Persistence**: Remembers your last used `last_message_id` across sessions.
- **Premium Reader**: Renders Markdown summaries with clickable links in a high-fidelity dark-mode interface.
